# riskprediction_corporatefinancemgt
The project aims to address the problem of fraud risk prediction in
corporate financial management. Fraudulent activities can have
detrimental effects on organizations, including financial losses and
reputational damage. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective
methods to identify and mitigate fraud risks.
The project proposes the use of machine learning techniques,
specifically the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, to develop a
predictive model for fraud risk detection. By analyzing historical
financial data and identifying patterns and anomalies, the model can
classify transactions or activities as either fraudulent or nonfraudulent.
The project involves several stages, including data gathering, data
preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature selection and
engineering, model training, model evaluation, and model
deployment. The gathered data is preprocessed, and relevant features
are selected or engineered to improve the model's accuracy. The
Random Forest Classifier is trained on labeled data and evaluated
using appropriate performance metrics.
The proposed solution offers the advantage of adaptability, as the
model can learn from new data and detect emerging fraud patterns.
By implementing this solution, organizations can strengthen their
fraud detection capabilities and make informed .<br></br>
